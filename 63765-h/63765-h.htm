<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The following pages are published with considerable
reluctance.&nbsp; The Author read Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s pamphlet
several weeks since, and was much pained that some of the
sentiments contained in it should proceed from such a
quarter.&nbsp; He hoped and expected that some one with more
leisure than he can command, and more capable of doing justice to
the important points under discussion, would undertake to refute
what he felt to be the very erroneous notions of the learned
Doctor.&nbsp; Since, however, no one else has taken up the
subject, he ventures to submit his sentiments to the Christian
public.&nbsp; He has no love for polemics, and very unwillingly
appears in print; but he has reason to know, that the notions to
which he alludes have already, in several instances, encouraged a
violation of the Sabbath, and that they are likely to produce
more extensive mischief, from the circumstance of no attempt
having been made to refute them.&nbsp; To prevent this evil, is
one object of the present undertaking.&nbsp; Another is, to
counteract the erroneous sentiments of Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s
pamphlet; while the writer&rsquo;s chief aim is, to set forth
what he believes to be the will of God on the important subject
of the Sabbath.&nbsp; He is convinced that the principles
enunciated in the following pages are in conformity with the
teaching of the Bible; and being fully assured that obedience to
the will of our Heavenly Father, is in all things the only way of
peace and safety, he will rejoice if this pamphlet shall become
the means of removing error, or of confirming those who already
believe that the Sabbath is of divine and perpetual
obligation.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>THE
DIVINE AND PERPETUAL OBLIGATION OF THE SABBATH.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> entering on the question
that we intend more particularly to discuss, there are some
remarks that we deem it necessary to make on the tone and general
character of Dr. Vaughan&rsquo;s pamphlet.&nbsp; And in the first
place, we were struck with the entire absence of scripture proof
in support of the views propounded.&nbsp; Assertions are made of
the most sweeping character, and inferences are thence drawn,
involving matters of the highest moment; and yet no passage of
scripture is adduced in support of these assertions.&nbsp; Thus
we are told &ldquo;that not only the fourth commandment, but the
whole decalogue has ceased to be, <i>as such</i>, the rule of our
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the authority for this declaration is
no-where given.&nbsp; If this doctrine be plainly taught in the
New Testament, surely we should be informed where it is to be
found.</p>
<p>Another thing that we could not help remarking, was the manner
in which the authority of the Old Testament is repudiated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With reference to the observance of the Sabbath, and to
every point of moral duty, the appeal now lies primarily to the
scriptures of the New Testament, and secondarily to any other
records which we may possess of the practice of the apostolical
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; How different is the mind of Dr. Vaughan from
that of the Apostle Paul on this important point.&nbsp; The
Apostle tells us (alluding more especially to the writings of the
Old Testament), that all scripture is &ldquo;profitable <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all
good works.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Vaughan tells us in effect, that our
rule of practice is the New Testament and tradition!</p>
<p>Again Dr. V. condemns what he designates &ldquo;a low and
slavish spirit,&rdquo; in those who wish &ldquo;to have an
express <i>law</i> to shew for our Christian Sunday.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But we would ask, whether an express law makes the obedience of
love less sincere, less warm, less free and spontaneous?&nbsp;
St. John tells us, &ldquo;this is the love of God, that we keep
his commandments, and his commandments are not
grievous.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a matter of such moment we feel bound
to follow the opinion of the inspired Apostle.</p>
<p>Dr. Vaughan is of opinion, that &ldquo;if we found even a
<i>human</i> institution, which testified throughout Christendom,
by a speaking sign, by an act at once self-denying and
beneficent, our faith in realities unseen and future; even
<i>this</i> would bind us to its observance.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet
when we find in the word of God, a plain command to keep holy the
Sabbath-day, we are told that we are not legally bound to observe
it, and that a wish to have a law to that effect, bespeaks
&ldquo;a low and slavish spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; If, however, the
express will of God does not lead men to keep the Sabbath, we
cannot conceive of any other motive, by which (on Christian
principles) they will be induced to observe it.&nbsp; In
man&rsquo;s present condition, liberty without law soon
degenerates into licentiousness; and no law but that of God, can
so restrain and regulate men, as to preserve real religious
freedom.&nbsp; Repeal the laws by which life and property are
protected, and try to persuade men to be good and virtuous, from
a love of virtue, or from a sense of gratitude for the kindness
and beneficence of their rulers; and we should soon see the
necessity and benefit of our laws.&nbsp; <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>And so it will
be found, that the religious observance of the Sabbath, will soon
give place to a general neglect of God&rsquo;s house, and to
practical atheism, if once the people are persuaded, that there
is no divine command to keep holy the Sabbath-day.</p>
<p>But while the authority of the Old Testament is thus
repudiated, the Rev. Doctor &ldquo;<i>thinks</i>&rdquo; <i>he</i>
&ldquo;<i>sees</i>&rdquo; (what other people may be blind to, and
about which he himself is <i>not quite certain</i>&mdash;so poor
a guide is man&rsquo;s intellect in the absence of a plain
command from God,) &ldquo;indications from the very earliest
days, of which the Scriptures contain the record, of man&rsquo;s
need of a periodical rest, and of God&rsquo;s purpose to secure
it to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believes &ldquo;that it is essential
to the well-being of his bodily and mental
structure.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believes that it &ldquo;is yet more
essential to the well-being of his immortal spirit, to his
education for that state in which earthly life
issues.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believes that this was &ldquo;foreseen by
man&rsquo;s Creator, and provided for by the disposer of
man&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet he does not believe that
God has adopted the only means of securing this all-important
blessing permanently to his creatures.&nbsp; Once, indeed, for a
few hundred years he made it imperative upon a small portion of
the human race, to keep an appointment so essential to
man&rsquo;s present and eternal welfare.&nbsp; But when by the
mission of his Son, and the publication of the gospel, he
manifested his marvellous love to the whole human race, then, by
an unaccountable and inexplicable mode of procedure, he set aside
this appointment, and left him to the dictates of his own will,
or to the selfishness or caprice of those under whose authority
he might happen to be!&nbsp; All was thenceforth to be left to
man&rsquo;s mental perception and moral sense! <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; Is <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>this view consistent with God&rsquo;s
goodness?&nbsp; Is it consistent with his general dealing with
men under the present dispensation?&nbsp; God has provided a
Saviour for all men.&nbsp; He has commanded the gospel to be
preached to the whole human race.&nbsp; He has commanded all men
every where to receive the gospel.&nbsp; And yet he has abolished
the only command by which an opportunity can be permanently
secured to all men, to become acquainted with the truths of the
gospel, and be made wise unto salvation!&nbsp; Is this worthy of
God?&nbsp; A human parent would not withhold from his children,
explicit instruction on any point that he deemed essential to
their welfare.&nbsp; He would not leave them to conjecture, but
would tell them plainly what was for their good.&nbsp; Is God
less wise or less good than man?</p>
<p>The Rev. Doctor evidently feels some difficulty in reconciling
his views with the teaching of the Church of England.&nbsp; For
after speaking of the privilege and blessing of Sabbath
observance, as if conscious of the dilemma in which his
principles placed him, he proceeds to ask, &ldquo;And shall those
who look back through long years upon their frequent failures to
improve the blessing, see no reason for the confession which
bewails their past neglect of it, and the prayer which asks help
to honour it (<i>i.e. the blessing</i>) hereafter?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now we <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>confess that we cannot help feeling, as we think most
must feel, that this attempt to escape from the appearance of
inconsistency in using the prayer alluded to, is most
unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The prayer to which allusion is here made,
is offered by the whole congregation immediately on the reading
of the fourth commandment by the Minister.&nbsp; Its language is,
&ldquo;Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep
this law.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the meaning and intent of the prayer
are thus expressed in the rubric at the head of the commandments
in the Communion Service: &ldquo;The Priest shall rehearse the
ten commandments; and the people shall, after every commandment,
ask God mercy for their transgression thereof for the time past,
and grace to keep the same for the time to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This, then, is the meaning of the prayer; and in this there is
necessarily implied a recognition of the moral obligation of the
commandment, with regret for its violation, as well as a prayer
for pardon, and for help to keep it in future.&nbsp; But is this
the meaning which Dr. Vaughan attaches to the language of this
prayer?&nbsp; No, with his views, it must be something of this
sort: &ldquo;Have mercy upon us for not improving this blessing
in time past, and incline our hearts to honour this blessing in
future.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely if the fourth commandment be no
longer in force, to use this prayer is to confess guilt where no
law has been transgressed, to ask pardon where no offence has
been committed, and to seek aid to amend what is not legally
wrong.</p>
<p>Nor is this the only practical difficulty connected with the
views in question.&nbsp; We presume it is the duty of the Masters
of our public schools, as well as of the Clergy generally, to
teach their charge the Church Catechism.&nbsp; But in the Church
Catechism are the following questions and answers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Question</i>.&nbsp; You said that your
godfathers and godmothers <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>did promise for you, that you should
keep God&rsquo;s commandments.&nbsp; Tell me how many there
be.</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; Ten.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>.&nbsp; Which be they?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; The same which God spake in the twentieth
chapter of Exodus, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a plain acknowledgment that the ten commandments are
still in force, and that we are bound by our baptismal vows to
keep them.&nbsp; Dr. Vaughan affirms that they have &ldquo;ceased
to be our rule of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; How can these conflicting
opinions be reconciled? or how can those persons consistently use
the formularies of our church, who so directly contradict her
teaching?</p>
<p>Having thus noticed more generally what we consider the
unscriptural opinions set forth in the pamphlet under review, we
shall now proceed to consider more particularly the Sabbath
question.&nbsp; This is confessedly one of the great questions of
the day.&nbsp; So momentous, indeed, are its bearings on the
temporal and spiritual well-being of men, and so intimately is it
connected with the worship and honour of God, that its importance
can scarcely be overrated.&nbsp; If God is to be publicly
acknowledged and worshiped in his own world&mdash;if men are to
be instructed in the principles of revealed religion, and trained
to habits of virtue and christian love&mdash;if personal,
domestic, social, and national happiness is to be
promoted&mdash;if time is to be so improved, as to make it the
passage to a blessed immortality&mdash;the obligation to keep the
Sabbath must be recognised, and its observance must be enforced
and regulated according to the injunctions of God&rsquo;s holy
word.</p>
<p>It is indeed asserted by some that, under the Christian
dispensation, the observance of a day of rest is a mere matter of
expediency&mdash;that we are under no divine obligation to <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>abstain from
labour or other worldly pursuits&mdash;that the Sabbath was
purely a Jewish institution, and has passed away with the other
&ldquo;weak and beggarly elements&rdquo; of Judaism.&nbsp; But on
what grounds are such assertions made? because, as it is alleged,
there is no positive command in the New Testament to keep the
Sabbath, &ldquo;no direction for its observance, nor any reproof
for the neglect of it,&rdquo; and because certain expressions are
employed by St. Paul, which seem to bespeak &ldquo;indifference
to its retention, or even rebuke for its revival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the first objection, viz. the want of a direct
command, this could scarcely be necessary, inasmuch as our Lord
not only himself kept the Sabbath, but in all his remarks in
reference to it, spoke in a manner that necessarily implied his
recognition of its divine origin and perpetual obligation.&nbsp;
Besides, as he expressly declared that he came not to destroy the
law or the prophets, (both of which are full of exhortations to
keep the Sabbath), what right have we to deny the obligation of
the fourth commandment, because it is not expressly repeated in
the New Testament?&nbsp; The safer and more just way of reasoning
would surely be this: Under the former dispensation God in the
most solemn manner promulgated a law, connecting with its
observance great temporal and especially great spiritual
blessings, and visiting its violation with the most severe
judgments.&nbsp; This law has not been formally and explicitly
abrogated, nor its sanctions withdrawn.&nbsp; The law, therefore,
still remains in force.&nbsp; Shew us that the fourth commandment
has been abrogated in as plain terms as those that were employed
in its promulgation; and then, and not till then, we may with a
safe conscience regard the observance of the Sabbath merely as a
matter of Christian expediency.</p>
<p>Where, again, was the necessity of &ldquo;direction&rdquo; for
the observance of the Sabbath, when the first Christians, (many
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>of whom,
as well as the Apostles, were Jews) had the services of the
Jewish synagogue as a model, and the plain instructions of the
law and prophets to guide them, both as to the proper manner of
keeping the Sabbath, and the spirit in which it should be
kept?&nbsp; We might as well deny the Christian obligation to
maintain the public worship of God, because in the New Testament
no directions are given for conducting it.</p>
<p>Nor would the absence of &ldquo;reproof for the neglect&rdquo;
of the Sabbath be any valid argument against the continued
obligation of its observance.&nbsp; If &ldquo;in the primitive
age&rdquo; there were &ldquo;churches in which <i>both</i> (the
Jewish and the Christian Sabbaths) were observed,&rdquo; it is
scarcely probable that any number of Christians would be found
who neglected the Sabbath altogether; and if there was little or
no neglect of the observance of the Sabbath, there would be
little or no room for reproof on account of its neglect.&nbsp;
But is there no reproof to be found in the New Testament?&nbsp;
What does St. Paul mean by exhorting the Hebrews not to neglect
the assembling of themselves together, as the manner of some was?
<a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp; Few will deny that this passage
refers to the public worship of the Christian church, which we
know was held on the Lord&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Here, then, we have
at least indirect reproof; and its connection with what follows
will perhaps suggest an additional reason for the absence of more
frequent and more direct reproof.&nbsp; So essential a part of
practical Christianity was the observance of the Sabbath deemed,
that scarcely any ventured to neglect it, and they who did so,
were considered in danger of apostasy. <a
name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a>&nbsp; If the reasons stated be valid
arguments against the divine obligation to keep the Sabbath, what
can be urged to prove the duty of females to partake of the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Sacrament of
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper?&nbsp; Here, although the institution was
entirely new, and peculiar to the new dispensation, yet we find
neither direct command, nor reproof for neglect, nor even mention
made of any females having partaken of that Sacrament.&nbsp; And
yet who would venture to pronounce these sufficient reasons for
denying the obligation of women to receive the memorials of their
dying Saviour&rsquo;s love?</p>
<p>With regard to those passages in which &ldquo;the language
employed is&rdquo; said to be &ldquo;that either of indifference
to its retention, or even of rebuke for its revival,&rdquo; we
apprehend that the intention of the apostle was neither to
condemn the observance of the Jewish Sabbath, nor to intimate
that Christians were under no moral obligation to keep any
Sabbath whatever.&nbsp; If he was speaking exclusively of the
Jewish weekly Sabbath (of which there is no sufficient proof),
his object was, either to vindicate Gentile Christians from the
obligation of its observance, or to condemn the self-righteous
spirit in which it was kept.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let no man judge you in
meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new
moon, or of the Sabbaths&rdquo; (or sabbatical appointments.) <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; All these were <i>Jewish</i>
ordinances, from which the council at Jerusalem, guided by the
Holy Ghost, had declared <i>Gentile</i> believers to be
free.&nbsp; They were local and national, and the various
sacrifices <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>and offerings connected with them could be presented
only at Jerusalem, and by Jews or proselytes.&nbsp; They were
therefore declared to be of no obligation to the Gentile
believer.&nbsp; On the contrary, these observances became
injurious both to Jewish and Gentile Christians, if they were
kept in a self-righteous spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid of you
(says St. Paul to the Galatians), lest I have bestowed upon you
labour in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye observe days, and months,
and times, and years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was the apostle rebuking his
brethren for the revival of what had &ldquo;died
out?&rdquo;&nbsp; Was he not rather blaming them for observing in
an antichristian spirit, what they were not <i>bound</i> to
observe at all?&nbsp; In his epistle to the Romans, he declares
that the observance of these days is in itself a matter of
indifference.&nbsp; &ldquo;One man esteemeth one day above
another, another esteemeth every day.&nbsp; He that regardeth the
day, regardeth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day,
to the Lord he doth not regard it.&rdquo; <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; How then could he be rebuking the
Galatians for simply doing what he himself declares might be done
with a good conscience, and acceptably to Christ?&nbsp; Besides
if the language of the Apostle must necessarily be understood as
conveying rebuke for observing the Sabbath, and consequently be a
valid proof, that the obligation to observe it is done away, much
more might the same argument be deduced from the still stronger
language employed by God in the book of the Prophet Isaiah:
&ldquo;Bring no more <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>vain oblations; incense is an
abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of
assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn
meeting.&nbsp; Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul
hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; What would have been thought of a
Jewish teacher who should have affirmed from this passage, that
the rites here enumerated were for ever abolished?&nbsp; And yet
such a view would have had more to support it, than the doctrine
attempted to be established by the statement of the
Apostle.&nbsp; In both cases, we apprehend, it was not the
observance that was condemned, nor the obligation that was
denied; but the reproof was levelled at the motives and the state
of mind by which the observance was attended.&nbsp; An antinomian
spirit was condemned by the Prophet&mdash;a self-righteous spirit
by the Apostle.</p>
<p>The absence of a formal abrogation of the Jewish Sabbath, and
the formal substitution of the Christian Sabbath in its place, is
in perfect accordance with the whole plan of divine providence,
for the introduction and establishment of Christianity in the
world.&nbsp; The religion of Moses was never formally
abolished.&nbsp; Our Lord lived and died in it; and his Apostles
and the early Jewish disciples occasionally at least observed its
rites, and still worshiped at the temple and in the
synagogue.&nbsp; Both religions were from God.&nbsp; Both had the
same end.&nbsp; The same truths and the same spirit were
essential to both.&nbsp; The shadows of the one gave place to the
substance of the other.&nbsp; But in all that was vital, moral,
saving, the two religions were identical.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was not
a Jew who was one outwardly, and circumcision was that of the
heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter.&rdquo;&nbsp; In like
manner we conceive, what was purely and necessarily Jewish in the
observance of <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>the Sabbath, passed away with the mere externals of
Judaism; but all that was essential to the spirit of the command
remained in full force.</p>
<p>But it is asked, if the observance of the Sabbath be of divine
and perpetual obligation, why have Christians changed the day,
and why do they not keep the Sabbath in the manner enjoined in
the Old Testament?&nbsp; We reply, that the lawgiver, the
&ldquo;Lord of the Sabbath,&rdquo; has by his own acts,
declarations, and example, and by the example of his inspired
Apostles, sanctioned both the change of the day, and the
alteration in the manner of its observance.&nbsp; Christianity
was not to be confined to one country, nor was it necessarily to
be a national religion.&nbsp; It was to overspread the world, and
was to be suited to all countries and climes.&nbsp; It was
therefore necessary that whatever was merely local and national
in the observance of the Sabbath, should be relaxed or removed;
and this might be done, and was done, without either touching the
moral obligation of the law, or taking from its observance a
particle of what is vital and essential. <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; Our Lord <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>did not
abrogate the seventh commandment when he declared, that the
unchaste look was a breach of it.&nbsp; Neither did he set aside
the fourth commandment, when he worked miracles of mercy on the
Sabbath day; when he defended his disciples who were blamed for
plucking ears of corn on the Sabbath day; when he declared it was
&ldquo;lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if
the seventh day had hitherto been kept as a sign between God the
Creator and his creature man, and as a memorial of creating
goodness; surely there was great propriety in changing the day,
so as to make the Sabbath observance a sign between God the
Redeemer and his redeemed creature man, and a memorial of
redeeming love, as well as an emblem of the eternal Sabbath, <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a> which is the hope of the
christian.&nbsp; Nor can we imagine that the most explicit
command for the change of the day, could have come with greater
force to the followers of Christ, than the recorded facts, that
the Saviour rose on the first day of the week, that after his
resurrection, he selected that day to meet his disciples, that
his people ever after regularly kept the first day, and that this
day bears in Scripture the honoured appellation of &ldquo;the
Lord&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this change, however, nothing
is given up that is essential in the command to keep holy the
Sabbath day.&nbsp; One day in seven is to be set apart to the
service of God; in it no unnecessary work is to be done; but <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>works of
necessity and of charity on that day are sanctioned by our Lord
himself.&nbsp; And this is so far from being opposed to what was
required under the former dispensation, that it agrees entirely
with the teaching of the prophet Isaiah, who instructed the Jews,
that the proper and acceptable way of keeping the Sabbath, was,
&ldquo;not to do their own ways,&rdquo; nor to &ldquo;speak their
own words,&rdquo; nor to &ldquo;find their own pleasure;&rdquo;
but to &ldquo;call the Sabbath a delight, holy of the Lord,
honourable.&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>Here it will be objected, that this reasoning proceeds on the
assumption, that the Sabbath is of divine and perpetual <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>obligation,
and that the justness of this assumption is altogether
denied.&nbsp; Well then, let us proceed to the proof.&nbsp; It
will not be denied, that in the law of the ten commandments,
commonly called the moral law, twice written by the finger of
God, and delivered to the Jews in the most solemn manner by the
voice of Jehovah himself, there is a plain command to &ldquo;keep
holy the Sabbath day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will not be denied, that
this appointment was made as &ldquo;a sign&rdquo; or memorial of
the relation that subsisted between God and his Church, and that
this sign was to be continued in succeeding generations.&nbsp; It
will not be denied, that this appointment was guarded by
sanctions of the most important kind&mdash;great blessings being
promised to its observance, and severe judgments being threatened
against those who should disregard it.&nbsp; In all this we see,
that to <i>the Jews</i> the observance of the Sabbath was of
divine obligation, and that that obligation continued so long as
the law itself was unrepealed.&nbsp; In other words, until the
same authority by which the law was promulgated, shall plainly
declare it abolished, every Jew is bound to keep the Sabbath, on
pain of incurring the displeasure of Almighty God.</p>
<p>But was the Jew the only person that was brought under the
sanctions of this law?&nbsp; Were not all proselytes from the
Gentiles bound by the same obligations, as they were also
partakers of the same blessings with the Jews?&nbsp; And does the
obligation stop even here?&nbsp; What is the meaning of this
passage from the prophet Isaiah?&nbsp; &ldquo;Also the sons of
the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and
to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants, every one that
keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my
covenant; even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make
them joyful in my house of prayer . . . for mine house <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>shall be
called a house of prayer for all people.&rdquo; <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a>&nbsp; Surely this language must have
reference to the times of the gospel, when the gentile nations
would be admitted into the church of God, and become partakers of
the blessings of the new covenant.&nbsp; In support of this view
it may be mentioned, that St. Paul states expressly that gentile
believers have no separate and independent standing in the
economy of redemption, but are as scions cut out of a wild olive
tree and grafted into the Jewish stock, and so with the natural
branches, partake of its root and fatness.&nbsp; Or, using
another figure, he reminds the Ephesians, that before their
conversion they had been &ldquo;aliens from the commonwealth of
Israel,&rdquo; but that now they were &ldquo;fellow citizens with
the saints, and of the household of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this
view be correct, and we see not how its correctness can be
disproved, the Sabbath with its responsibilities and its
blessings, is not confined to Jews, or to proselytes to the
Jewish religion.&nbsp; Its observance is binding upon all who
profess to believe the scriptures and to worship the God of the
Bible.</p>
<p>We cannot help regarding as very untenable the opinion of
those, who dissever the fourth commandment from the rest of the
decalogue, under the plea that it is not properly speaking
<i>moral</i>, <a name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a> and therefore has not the same force
as the commandments of the second table&mdash;as if the express
command of our Maker were not infinitely above every
consideration arising from the nature of the injunction given, or
as if man&rsquo;s reason <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>or man&rsquo;s moral sense were
competent to make a distinction where God has made none.&nbsp;
What right have we, under any pretence whatever, to deny the
obligation of a law, so plainly, so solemnly, so awfully
promulgated by the God of heaven himself?&nbsp; The very position
of the fourth commandment in the decalogue, might teach men to
regard it with peculiar veneration.&nbsp; It is the link that
binds together heaven and earth&mdash;our duty to God and our
duty to our neighbour.&nbsp; It is the pillar that supports the
whole moral and religious fabric.&nbsp; To attempt to set aside
the obligation to observe the fourth commandment, is therefore,
in our view, a daring attack on the authority of the
Lawgiver.&nbsp; It is a temerity equalled only by that of the
church of Rome in expunging from the decalogue the second
commandment.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the greater consistency of those who affirm,
that the whole moral law is swept away by the gospel; though we
much regret that any true Christians, and those too, persons who
are friendly to a proper observance of the Lord&rsquo;s day,
should hold notions which appear to us opposed to Scripture, and
calculated to produce among the unthinking multitude, the most
serious consequences.&nbsp; If indeed it were true, that the
whole decalogue is abrogated by Christianity, no supposed immoral
results would deter us from boldly proclaiming the fact.&nbsp; In
that case, we should not shrink from telling men that our church
is under a serious mistake, when she teaches her members to
confess their guilt in breaking each of the ten commandments, to
ask for pardon, and to implore grace to keep them in time to
come.&nbsp; But it is because we believe in our heart that the
decalogue is still in force, and that God&rsquo;s honour and
man&rsquo;s happiness alike demand its observance, that we are
not &ldquo;bold enough&rdquo; to proclaim as
&ldquo;liberty&rdquo; what we are sure would lead to the greatest
licentiousness.&nbsp; <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>A theory of the kind may not
seriously injure men of real piety and great spirituality of
mind; but to others it would be productive of the most lamentable
consequences.</p>
<p>But if Christianity has freed us from the moral law, an
announcement to that effect must be recorded in the New
Testament, and recorded in no obscure or doubtful terms, such as
can by any possibility be misunderstood, but in language as
plain, as perspicuous, and as authoritative, as that employed in
the original promulgation of the law.&nbsp; For here we are not
called upon to give up merely some external observance, or to
change the mode or the time of performing some appointed duty
(for <i>that</i> a less explicit intimation of the divine will
would suffice); but we are told to renounce what in its very
nature is essential to all acceptable obedience, and what above
every other part of revelation bears marks of the divine
impress.&nbsp; If the moral law is to be renounced as part of
&ldquo;the weak and beggarly elements&rdquo; of the Mosaic
religion, we must have the voice of God as distinctly abrogating
the ten commandments as it was heard in their original
promulgation.&nbsp; Nothing less will satisfy us, and nothing
else, we venture to say, ought to satisfy any man who believes,
that at the bar of God he must answer for the use he has made of
the divine revelation contained in the Bible. <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p>Now, can any man shew, or does any man pretend to shew, a
single passage of scripture in which it is plainly stated, that
the decalogue is abrogated under the Christian
dispensation?&nbsp; We are well aware that obedience to the law
forms no part of man&rsquo;s justification&mdash;for
&ldquo;Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
one that believeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know too that love is the
essence of all obedience&mdash;for &ldquo;love is the fulfilling
of the law.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we know likewise that &ldquo;this is
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the love
of God, that we keep his commandments.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor can we
conceive how the purest and most fervent love can be properly
manifested, towards God or man, without some infallible guidance
for its expression in the different relations of life. <a
name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a>&nbsp; This we have briefly and
essentially in the decalogue; while the principles there
enunciated, are in the prophets and in the New Testament more
fully developed and expanded.&nbsp; And in the absence of some
plain revelation to justify such a course, we would fain know on
what principle the <i>comment</i> (so to speak) is retained, when
the <i>text</i> itself is rejected.&nbsp; If the law written by
the finger of God and published by his own mouth may thus be
ignored, what reason can be urged for listening to the moral
teaching of Prophets and Apostles?&nbsp; But if the law of the
ten commandments has not been annulled, the command to keep the
Sabbath is still in force.&nbsp; For he that said &ldquo;thou
shalt not kill,&rdquo; said also, &ldquo;remember the Sabbath day
to keep it holy.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this ground then we rest our
defence of the divine and perpetual obligation of the
Sabbath.&nbsp; God has not revoked his own solemn decree
published with his own lips on Mount Sinai.&nbsp; Till this is
done, the decree with all its sanctions continues in full
force.</p>
<p>Here we are content to stop; though we feel that the argument
might be carried much further.&nbsp; For we believe that had
there been no command in the law of Moses, enjoining the
observance of the Sabbath; still both Jews and Gentiles would
have been bound by the original institution, <a
name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> coeval <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>with man&rsquo;s being, and forming
the only positive appointment of God, imposed on our first
parents in a state of innocency.&nbsp; He &ldquo;blessed the
seventh day, and sanctified it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This thought will
probably have little weight with those who are not convinced by
our previous arguments; but it will doubtless lead some to
reflect, that if the Sabbath was needed for man&rsquo;s welfare
even in the garden of Eden, much more is it required for the good
of both body and soul in his present condition of sin and toil
and sorrow; and that if the Father of Goodness gave his sinless
creatures a day of rest from worldly employment, and a weekly
Sabbath for more continued and intimate communion with himself;
the compassion of the same gracious Being would not only lead him
to continue the appointment, now so much more needed in
man&rsquo;s fallen state, but also to command such an observance
of the day, as man&rsquo;s altered circumstances rendered
necessary.&nbsp; Now, this can only be effected by making it
imperative on all to &ldquo;keep holy&rdquo; the sacred day
themselves, and to afford to others facilities to keep it.&nbsp;
If it were to be regarded merely as a privilege, to be enjoyed or
neglected at pleasure, it would <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>not answer the end intended.&nbsp; In
man&rsquo;s present condition, he cannot by nature appreciate the
boon, nor desire the spiritual blessings that the appointment is
especially intended to convey.&nbsp; The observance of the
Sabbath must therefore be laid upon his conscience as a duty,
that in seeking to fulfil that duty, he may be continually
brought under the means of grace, and the influence of Christian
principles, until by God&rsquo;s grace he is led to feel the
blessedness of a well spent Sabbath, and keeps from a motive of
love, what he at first observed from a sense of duty.</p>
<h2><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> persons require a proof that
the decalogue is binding on Christians.&nbsp; They acknowledge
that it is still in force towards the Jews.&nbsp; But assuming
that the whole Jewish economy is abrogated with regard to
Christians, they demand evidence from the New Testament that the
ten commandments are a rule of duty to us.&nbsp; Now this is a
demand they have no right to make.&nbsp; It proceeds on an
assumption, the correctness of which we deny.&nbsp; It is
therefore, the part of those who maintain that view, to prove
that the moral law has ceased to be in force; not of us, to shew
the contrary.</p>
<p>While, however, we maintain our vantage ground, and contend
that nothing less than a plain declaration in the New Testament
to that effect, can or ought to satisfy us, that the decalogue is
annulled, we do not despair of being able to satisfy any candid
mind, by an appeal to the New Testament, that we are as much
bound by the ten commandments as are the Jews, to whom they were
originally given.</p>
<p>No one can say, that there is an express declaration in the
New Testament, to the effect, that the decalogue is set aside
under the present dispensation.&nbsp; Those who arrive at the
conclusion, must confess, that it is merely inferential.&nbsp; In
this respect, then, both parties stand on equal ground.&nbsp;
Neither our opponents nor ourselves can adduce an undoubted and
positive declaration.&nbsp; But we ask which have the greatest
need of such a declaration&mdash;they who assert that the moral
law, written and pronounced by God himself, has been abrogated,
or they who affirm that it is still in force?&nbsp; On which side
lies the greater probability, and with whom rests the greater
responsibility?&nbsp; No very serious harm can result from the
error (if such it be) of maintaining the perpetual authority of
the moral law, but the most disastrous consequences may flow from
the rejection of its claims.&nbsp; And surely it is more likely
that God would continue his own law in force without a direct
renewal of it, than that <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>he would abrogate it without a plain
announcement to that effect.&nbsp; In the absence then of
positive evidence, the probability lies on the side of its
retention.</p>
<p>Now, this probability advances a step towards certainty, when
it is remembered, that Judaism is not formally abrogated in the
New Testament&mdash;that in fact Christianity is not a new
religion, but the extension and expansion of the moral and
spiritual part of the Mosaic dispensation&mdash;believing Jews
still remaining on their own stock, and believing Gentiles being
scions grafted into the Jewish olive tree.&nbsp; The religion of
Jesus is in reality the perfection of the religion of
Moses.&nbsp; But where would be its superiority in a moral point
of view, if the authority of the very standard of morality were
taken from it?&nbsp; At any rate, if such were the case, some
express intimation to that effect is to be expected.</p>
<p>This argument is still further strengthened by the fact, that
the spirit and essential requirements of Judaism and Christianity
are identical.&nbsp; It has indeed been asserted that the
morality of the Old Testament was one of legal enactment; whereas
that of the New Testament is one of motives and principles.&nbsp;
But our Lord teaches a very different doctrine.&nbsp; He tells us
that love was the essence and sum of all the requirements of the
Old Testament, even as love is the fulfilling of the law under
the present dispensation. <a name="citation27"></a><a
href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a>&nbsp; Christianity
presents a new and powerful motive for obedience&mdash;namely
gratitude for the incarnation and death of the Son of God; but
this neither changes the nature of man&rsquo;s moral obligation,
nor removes the necessity of a positive enactment to guide him in
his obedience, and enforce conformity to God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp;
If then in spirit and essence the moral requirements of the law
and of the gospel were the same, what reason should there be for
setting aside the decalogue, and what authority have we to ignore
it without an express command from God?</p>
<p>The probability that the moral law remains in force under the
present dispensation, is still further strengthened by the use
which is made of it by the inspired writers of the New
Testament.&nbsp; St. Paul indeed speaks of the law as the
&ldquo;ministry of condemnation,&rdquo; in opposition to the
gospel, which is the &ldquo;ministry of righteousness,&rdquo; or
justification&mdash;the one dispensation bearing on its front the
justice of God, the other, his mercy.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>He
tells us plainly that the law can only condemn, while the gospel
alone has power to justify.&nbsp; He assures us that in this
respect&mdash;in its condemning power&mdash;it is &ldquo;done
away&rdquo; to the believer, while the free grace of the gospel
alone &ldquo;remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when he speaks of the
moral requirements of Christianity, while he tells us that (as in
the religion of Moses) love is the essence and sum of all, he
nevertheless sends us to the commandments of the second table, to
learn how love is to be exhibited, or rather perhaps to shew us,
that the moral requirements of the two dispensations were
essentially the same. <a name="citation28a"></a><a
href="#footnote28a" class="citation">[28a]</a>&nbsp; What an
extraordinary use to make of the law, if the decalogue be part of
&ldquo;the weak and beggarly elements&rdquo; abolished by
Christianity.&nbsp; St. John tells us that to love God is to keep
his commandments.&nbsp; But we know not which of his commandments
we are bound to keep, if we reject those which he wrote with his
own finger, and pronounced with his own voice.&nbsp; St. James
refers to the moral law as if recognising its obligation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all.&nbsp; For he that said, Do not commit
adultery, said also, Do not kill.&nbsp; Now, if thou commit no
adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the
law.&rdquo; <a name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a>&nbsp; It may be objected, that this
reference to the law is merely for the purpose of
illustration.&nbsp; But surely if the violation of one precept
involves the guilt of breaking the whole law, the whole law must
still be in force.&nbsp; For if the enactment has been repealed,
there is no law; and if there is no law, there can be no
transgression; and if there is no transgression, there can be no
guilt.&nbsp; How strange, too, is this appeal to the law by the
Apostle Paul, if the law has been annulled: &ldquo;Children obey
your parents in the Lord; for this is right.&nbsp; Honour thy
father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise;
that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long on
the earth.&rdquo; <a name="citation28c"></a><a
href="#footnote28c" class="citation">[28c]</a>&nbsp; We thus
approach very near the establishment of our position, that there
is evidence in the New Testament, that the moral law is still
binding on men.</p>
<p>It may indeed be objected, that in the scriptures quoted or
alluded to, the reference is chiefly, if not exclusively, to the
second table of the decalogue.&nbsp; But we think few will
venture to deny, (especially after the assertion of St. James,
that the violation of one precept is the violation of <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the whole
law) that if the part which regulates our duty to man is in
force, the part which teaches our duty to God must be equally in
force.&nbsp; Besides, if love is the fulfilling of the law, and
the love of God is keeping his commandments, how can we express
our love to him, if we reject that part of the law, which
especially guides us in the proper manner of shewing our love
<i>directly</i> to him?</p>
<p>But there is one passage of the New Testament, which, in the
absence of a positive enunciation to the contrary, to our mind,
of itself establishes the permanent authority of the decalogue,
and which, when added to what has already been said, more than
completes the proof that has been demanded of us.&nbsp; We allude
to our Lord&rsquo;s declaration: &ldquo;Think not that I am come
to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy but
to fulfil.&nbsp; For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law,
till all be fulfilled.&rdquo; <a name="citation29a"></a><a
href="#footnote29a" class="citation">[29a]</a>&nbsp; There can
scarcely be a doubt to what the Redeemer refers when he speaks of
&ldquo;the law and the prophets.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not intend
the ceremonial law, because the breaking of its least commands
would not make a man &ldquo;least in the kingdom of
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither was it true that he did not come to
put an end to its observance.&nbsp; It is the moral law, and
those instructions of the prophets which flow from it&mdash;it is
&ldquo;the law and the prophets&rdquo; as embraced in the
precept, &ldquo;thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and thy neighbour as thyself,&rdquo; which our Lord
evidently meant.&nbsp; The entire discourse to which this
declaration forms the introduction, is of a moral character; and
whatever meanings may have been put upon our Lord&rsquo;s
language, we think any unbiased mind, on reading the whole
discourse, will come to the conclusion, that the moral law was
chiefly and prominently in the Saviour&rsquo;s mind, when he
employed the language above quoted. <a name="citation29b"></a><a
href="#footnote29b" class="citation">[29b]</a>&nbsp; But if one
jot or tittle cannot <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>pass away from the law, how should
the entire law be abrogated?&nbsp; We conclude, therefore, that
there is satisfactory evidence in the New Testament, that the
decalogue is still in force in the Christian church&mdash;not so
indeed that obedience to it forms the ground of the
believer&rsquo;s justification, or that want of perfect
conformity to its requirements brings him under condemnation
(this was not the case under the Jewish dispensation), but as the
standard of right and wrong, as the infallible regulator of
conscience, as that perfect rule of moral obligation, by seeking
conformity to which we honour our Creator and Redeemer, perform
the duties of this present life, and become fitted for the
presence of God and the inheritance of the saints in light.&nbsp;
To the believer the moral law has always been &ldquo;the law of
liberty,&rdquo; because, it being &ldquo;written in his
heart,&rdquo; he has &ldquo;delighted in it after the inner
man,&rdquo; and kept its precepts from a principle of love.</p>

the power of man&rsquo;s mental and moral perception of what is
right and wrong.&nbsp; But from whom do we hear most on these
subjects?&nbsp; From those who, having lighted their torch at the
lamp of God, affect not only to be independent of divine
illumination, but even to eclipse the light of heaven
itself.&nbsp; If they will fairly test their own principles, let
them try them by the condition of that portion of the human
family on whom revelation never cast its direct rays.&nbsp; Let
them seek in the records of the heathen nations of antiquity, or
in the principles and practice of modern heathendom, for proofs
of man&rsquo;s inherent power to think and act aright.&nbsp; They
will then find that their wisdom is folly, their religion the
most degrading idolatry, and that their moral code allows and
even commands actions of the most revolting kind.&nbsp; The moral
sense of the New Zealander made him a cannibal.&nbsp; In the
Hindu it is seen in the worship of the Linga, in the horrid rites
of the Suttee, and in the filthy and unnatural crimes that form a
part of what is considered their most acceptable worship.&nbsp;
It is hardly necessary to refer the classical reader to such

defective plural &sigma;&#8049;&beta;&beta;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;
occur, both in the New Testament and in the Septuagint, we are
satisfied that the following extract from Bishop Horsley&rsquo;s
Third Sermon on the Sabbath, gives the proper exposition of the
passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must not quit this part of my subject
without briefly taking notice of a text in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Epistle to the Colossians, which has been supposed to contradict
the whole doctrine which I have asserted, and to prove that the
observation of a Sabbath in the Christian church is no point of
duty, but a matter of mere compliance with ancient custom . .
.&nbsp; From this text no less a man than the venerable Calvin
drew the conclusion, in which he has been rashly followed by
other considerable men, that the sanctification of the seventh
day is no indispensable duty in the Christian church&mdash;that
it is one of those carnal ordinances of the Jewish religion which
our Lord hath blotted out.&nbsp; The truth however is, that in
the apostolical age, the first day of the week, though it was
observed with great reverence, was not called the Sabbath day,
but the Lord&rsquo;s day . . . and the name of the Sabbath days
was appropriated to the Saturdays, and certain days in the Jewish
church, which were likewise called Sabbaths in the law.&nbsp; The
Sabbath days, therefore, of which St. Paul speaks, were not the
Sundays of Christians, but the Saturdays and other Sabbaths of
the Jewish calendar.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[16]</a>&nbsp; We are reminded of certain
expressions in some of the Fathers, from which it is inferred,
that they did not deem it necessary to keep the Lord&rsquo;s day
so strictly as we contend it ought to be kept; and that
Constantine passed a decree permitting persons in the rural
districts, to get in their crops on Sunday, should the weather be
such as to threaten their destruction or serious injury.&nbsp;
Without discussing the propriety of the particular edict in
question, we deem it a sufficient answer, that the Bible, and not
the Fathers or Constantine, is our rule of faith and
practice.&nbsp; Many erroneous notions were held by the Fathers;
and no one will pretend that either Constantine or the church
generally in his days, was so correct in practice, as to present
a perfect model for us to follow.</p>
<p>We are also reminded, that there were some in the early
church&mdash;slaves, for instance&mdash;who could not keep the
Lord&rsquo;s day; and these, it is argued, would rather have died
than have desecrated it, had they considered it of the same
obligation as the command to abstain from idolatry.&nbsp; To this
it may be replied, that the question is not what certain
individuals thought, or what was the practice of certain
communities, but what the word of God teaches.&nbsp; There is,
however, a marked distinction between the two cases here
supposed, arising from the difference between the two
commandments.&nbsp; Many instances may occur, in which it is
physically impossible to obey the letter of some of the
commandments.&nbsp; Thus, poverty, sickness, or other
providential impediment, may incapacitate the most obedient child
from ministering to the wants of his parents.&nbsp; In like
manner, bodily infirmity, imprisonment, or other providential
restraint, may prevent the observance of the fourth commandment
in the letter, while the heart longs to honour God&rsquo;s holy
day, and to enjoy its blessings.&nbsp; The Christian slave,
therefore, whose body (in the providence of God) was under the
power of his master, might be compelled to work on the
Lord&rsquo;s day without incurring guilt.&nbsp; But he could not
worship an idol, without an open renunciation of
Christianity.&nbsp; Surely there is no need to insist on the
difference between the two cases.</p>

<p><a name="footnote18"></a><a href="#citation18"
class="footnote">[18]</a>&nbsp; We cannot see the distinction
contended for by some, between the Jewish Sabbath and the
Christian Lord&rsquo;s day; namely, that the former was
&ldquo;<i>rest</i>,&rdquo; while the latter is &ldquo;<i>public
worship</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; To us they appear identical.&nbsp; The
Jewish Sabbath was not merely &ldquo;<i>rest</i>,&rdquo; but
<i>holy</i> or <i>sanctified</i> rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
<i>blessed</i> the seventh day, and <i>sanctified</i>
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moses calls it &ldquo;the rest of the
<i>holy</i> Sabbath unto the Lord;&rdquo; and God frequently
declares that it was appointed as a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; between
himself and his people, and commands them to keep it
<i>holy</i>.&nbsp; Now, how could the Jewish Sabbath answer the
description thus given of it, if mere rest, or cessation from
bodily labour, was all that was required in its observance?&nbsp;
We know that the Sunday, as kept by those who only lay aside
their usual worldly employments, is neither
&ldquo;blessed,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;sanctified,&rdquo; nor
&ldquo;holy,&rdquo; nor a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; between them and
God.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is made the occasion of the most
awful immoralities, and is productive of the greatest
misery.&nbsp; Instead of a blessing, it is converted into a
curse.&nbsp; Besides, did not the instructions of the heads of
families, and the teaching and ministrations of the Levites, in
the earlier part of the Jewish history, and the services at the
synagogue in after times, afford means of instruction very
similar to those in the Christian church?&nbsp; By divine
appointment the Levites were to teach the people (Lev. x. 11;
Deut. xxxiii. 10), and the people were to teach their children
(Deut. vi. 7); and we cannot conceive how this could have been
done, or the Sabbath have been kept <i>holy</i>, according to the
commandment, without some stated instruction and worship on the
day of rest, from the first settlement of the Israelites in
Canaan.&nbsp; A whole nation keeping <i>holy</i> every seventh
day, without the aids and restraints of public worship, appears
to us an impossibility.&nbsp; Indeed, why is the Sabbath
expressly called &ldquo;a holy <i>convocation</i>&rdquo;
[&#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;] (Levit.
xxiii. 3), if no assemblies of the people for worship took place
on that day?&nbsp; But after all, what do the advocates of the
strictest observance of the Sabbath require, more than was
required of the Jews by God himself? (Isa. lviii. 13.)&nbsp; We
therefore consider the Jewish Sabbath and the Christian Sunday,
the same in spirit, in character, and in their general religious
requirements.</p>

<p><a name="footnote20b"></a><a href="#citation20b"
class="footnote">[20b]</a>&nbsp; The fourth commandment is in its
nature partly <i>moral</i> and partly <i>positive</i>.&nbsp;
Reason teaches the duty of devoting a portion of our time to the
worship of God.&nbsp; Revelation determines the amount by a
positive enactment.&nbsp; Now, it is very remarkable, that while
<i>all</i> the other sabbatical institutions (which are peculiar
to the Jews) are omitted in the moral law and inserted in the
ceremonial law, that of the seventh day alone stands in the
decalogue.&nbsp; Is not this a tacit indication of its moral
character?</p>

<p><a name="footnote23a"></a><a href="#citation23a"
class="footnote">[23a]</a>&nbsp; How often has the fondest love
of parents become destructive to their offspring, for want of
proper regulation in its expression.&nbsp; So, love to God and
man, if mere feeling, without proper intellectual guidance, might
produce results the reverse of its intention.&nbsp; It would be
the propelling power without the regulator.</p>
<p><a name="footnote23b"></a><a href="#citation23b"
class="footnote">[23b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a gross mistake to
consider the Sabbath as a mere festival of the Jewish church,
deriving its whole sanctity from the Levitical law.&nbsp; The
contrary appears, as well from the evidence of the fact which
sacred history affords, as from the reason of the thing which the
same history declares.&nbsp; The religious observation of the
seventh day hath a place in the decalogue among the very first
duties of natural religion.&nbsp; The reason assigned for the
injunction is general, and hath no relation or regard to the
particular circumstances of the Israelites.&nbsp; The creation of
the world was an event equally interesting to the whole human
race; and the acknowledgment of God as our Creator, is a duty in
all ages and in all countries, equally incumbent upon every
individual of mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; From <i>Bishop
Horsley&rsquo;s Second Sermon on the Sabbath</i>.</p>
<p>Professor Blunt has elaborately demonstrated, that the Sabbath
was observed in the <i>Patriarchal age</i>.&nbsp; See
<i>Scriptural Coincidences</i>, pp. 18&ndash;24.&nbsp; The
hebdomadal division of time by the Pagan nations of the West, and
by the Hindus and other people in the East, seems to indicate a
traditional recognition of the Sabbath, though the observance of
the day, as a day of rest, passed away with the worship of Him,
in whose honour it was originally instituted.</p>

class="footnote">[29b]</a>&nbsp; Our Lord refers to some of the
moral precepts, and to some of the civil enactments of the law of
Moses; because the meaning and application of both had been
perverted or obscured by the glosses of the Scribes and
Pharisees; and his intention evidently was, to remove those false
glosses, and to teach the legitimate application, meaning, and
extent of the divine commandments.&nbsp; Thus, the civil
enactment, &ldquo;An eye for an eye,&rdquo; &amp;c. was perverted
by the Pharisees, so as to encourage the notion, that personal
revenge was justifiable by the divine law.&nbsp; This perversion
was met by our Lord&rsquo;s command, &ldquo;Resist not
evil,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Again, God had commanded the Jews to
love their neighbours as themselves.&nbsp; The Scribes, it would
seem, chose to infer that this command necessarily implied the
inculcation of an opposite feeling towards enemies.&nbsp; They
therefore interpreted the precept to mean &ldquo;Thou shalt love
thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our Lord gave
the most decided negative to this gloss, by his injunction,
&ldquo;love your enemies,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Moreover, the
Scribes taught that the mere outward observance of the precept
was all that the law required.&nbsp; Our Lord shewed that God
regards the inward feelings and motives of men&mdash;that the
unchaste desire was adultery, and that causeless anger was
murder.&nbsp; In this, his object was not to condemn or
contradict the teaching of the law and the prophets, but to free
it from human perversion, to shew its real character, and to
point out its moral beauty and excellency.&nbsp; Hence his solemn
assertion, that not one jot or tittle should pass from the
law.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
